	"Description": "This configuration demonstrates chemical reactions in the mesoscopic
		regime. We define a single subvolume so there is no diffusion. There is also
		no active actor; all molecules are generated via a 0th order chemical reaction.
		This file has no 2nd order reactions so it is also possible to run in the
		microscopic regime by setting the microscopic property in the region definition to true.
		A separate and similarly-named sample config file has that setting.
		The default reaction rates result in an expected equilibrium value of 100 molecules
		in the reactor. This simulation with 100 repeats should take less than 1 second to
		execute on a personal computer (it is much faster than its microscopic equivalent
		since there is no diffusion modeled at all here).",
