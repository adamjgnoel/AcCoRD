 * chem_rxn.h - structure for storing chemical reaction properties
 *
 * Last revised for v1.0 (2016-10-31)
 *
 * Revision history:
 *
 * Revision v1.0 (2016-10-31)
 * - enabled local diffusion coefficients. Chemical reactions involving surface
 * interactions can specify the diffusion coefficient to use in transition
 * probabilities as a reaction parameter (default is the molecule's default
 * diffusion coefficient)
 *
 * Revision v0.6 (public beta, 2016-05-30)
 * - preliminary implementation of bimolecular reactions in microscopic regime
 * (based on binding and unbinding radii). Can also model molecular crowding
 * - added new members to region array structure to facilitate microscopic
 * bimolecular reactions
 * - added indicator for whether reactions in the global reaction lists can occur
 * in given region, which is needed to asses bimolecular reactions where the
 * reactants are in different regions
 *
 * Revision v0.5.1 (2016-05-06)
 * - added label, bReversible, and labelCoupled so that reactions can be named
 * and coupled together
 * - added bReleaseProduct for surface reactions to indicate which products are
 * released from the surface
 * - updated reaction probabilities for surface reactions so that user has
 * choices for what calculation to use. Added types to store user choices
 * - adsorption, desorption, and membrane probability calculations are mostly based on
 * S.S. Andrews, "Accurate particle-based simulation of adsorption, desorption
 * and partial transmission" Physical Biology, vol. 6, p.046015, 2009
 * - constrained absorbing and desorbing reactions to one per type of molecule
 * at a given region. In many cases these reactions are now treated separately
 * from other types of 1st order reactions
 * - constrained membrane reactions to one inner and one outer reaction per type of
 * molecule at a given membrane region.
 *
 * Revision v0.5 (2016-04-15)
 * - removed limit on number of molecule types
 * - removed limit on number of products in a reaction
 * - added region label when giving errors about region initialization
 * - added bSurface, surfRxnType members to reaction structure to add specialized reactions
 * - implementations of some surface reactions
 *
 * Revision v0.4.1
 * - improved use and format of error messages
 *
 * Revision v0.4
 * - modified use of unsigned long and unsigned long long to uint32_t and uint64_t
 * - modified propensity updates to do a full re-calculation in order to avoid
 * numerical underflow problems
 * - removed deprecated debug function
 * - added restriction of chemical reactions to specific regions
 * - renamed region structure and array of structures to accommodate naming
 * of new boundary structure
 *
 * Revision v0.3.1
 * - header added
