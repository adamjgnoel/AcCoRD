% accordPlotMakerWrapper.m - Wrapper function for accordPlotMaker, which
%   can create a plot from AcCoRD simulation output.
%   This file prepares all of the input arguments needed for
%   accordPlotMaker.
%   RECOMMENDATION: TO USE THIS FUNCTION, YOU SHOULD MAKE A COPY AND MODIFY
%   THE COPY.
%
% INPUTS
% NONE - this file is intended to be a wrapper that is modified directly.
%   Descriptions of the input arguments for accordVideoMaker are described
%   as they are initialized below.
%
% OUTPUTS
% hFig - handle(s) to plotted figure(s). Use for making changes.
% hAxes - handle(s) to axes in plotted figure(s). Use for making changes.

%% 

% hAxes - handle to plotting axes. If 0, a new figure will be created.
%   Otherwise, curve will be added to existing axes
hAxes = 0;

% fileToLoad - simulation file generated by accordImport from raw AcCoRD
%   simulation output. The '.mat' extension can be omitted. File should
%   have 'data' and 'config' structures.
fileToLoad = 'accord_sample_out';

% customFigProp - structure of figure properties to change from AcCoRD
%   defaults. Can be passed as empty if no defaults are to be changed. See
%   accordBuildFigureStruct for structure fields and their default values.
%   If plot will be a surface, and face colors are being set by the figure
%   colormap, then the Colormap can be set here.
customFigProp = [];

% customAxesProp - structure of axes properties to change from AcCoRD
%   defaults. Can be passed as empty if no defaults are to be changed. See
%   accordBuildAxesStruct for structure fields and their default values.
%   NOTE: It is highly recommended to change the default Visible and
%   Projection properties, since the default settings favor video
%   generation and not curve plotting
customAxesProp.Visible = 'on';
customAxesProp.Projection = 'orthographic';
customAxesProp.Clipping = 'on';

% passiveActorToPlot - index of passive recording actors whose
%   signals are to be plotted. Indexing matches the list of passive
%   actors whose observations are recorded (as stored in the data structure
%   in fileToLoad).
passiveID = 1;

% molID - index of molecules to display. Indexing corresponds to the
%   list of molecules that the actor is recording (as stored in the data
%   structure in fileToLoad).
molID = 1;

% customObsProp - structure of data display properties to change
%   from AcCoRD defaults. Can be passed as empty if no defaults are to be
%   changed. See accordBuildObserverStruct for structure fields and their
%   default values. Header of accordBuildObserverStruct includes full
%   details on how to specify each type of plot.
customObsProp = [];

% customCurveProp - structure of display properties to change
%   from AcCoRD defaults. Can be passed as empty if no defaults are to be
%   changed. The specific properties depend on the definition of
%   customObsProp.obsType, which is 'Sample' by default
%
% If the data to display is 2D, then see accordBuildCurveStruct for
%   structure fields and their default values.
% If the data to display is 3D, then see accordBuildSurfStruct for
%   structure fields and their default values. Applies to all types that
%   have "3D" in their name
customCurveProp = [];
