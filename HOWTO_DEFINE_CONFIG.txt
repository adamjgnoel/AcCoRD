// Last revised for AcCoRD v1.0 (2016-10-31)
//
// Revision history:
//
// Revision v1.0 (2016-10-31)

// releases molecules. Can release multiple types of molecules
// - added local diffusion coefficients defined for individual regions
// - added local diffusion coefficient to apply specifically to calculate a
// surface interaction reaction probability
// - changed convention for defining region anchor coordinates and the number of
// subvolumes along each dimension of rectangular regions. Old convention is still
// supported
//
// Revision v0.6 (2016-05-30)
// - added new properties for bimolecular reactions in microscopic regime
// - added new options for active actors, which can now be points and have
// constant data sequences
// - added option for choice of hybrid transition algorithm
//
// Revision v0.5.1 (2016-05-06)
// - describe new properties for chemical reactions (particularly surface reactions)
//
// Revision v0.5 (2016-04-15)

// - added ability to choose what regions a chemical reaction can occur in
//
// Revision v0.3.1.1
// - added comment that a child region must be fully defined within the boundary of its parent
//
// Revision v0.3.1
// - header added
// - added "Warning Override" member to main object
//
// WARNING: THIS IS NOT A REAL CONFIGURATION FILE!!!
// THE "COMMENTS" IN THIS FILE MAKE IT INVALID JSON!
// BUT ... THIS FILE DESCRIBES HOW TO WRITE A VALID CONFIGURATION FILE
//
// With that out of the way, welcome to this "tutorial" for preparing proper
// AcCoRD configuration files.
//
// This document is current as of v0.6 (2016-05-30).
//
// Please note that valid configuration files cannot have these comments
// preceded by "//". If you remove these comments and place a copy of
// this file where AcCoRD can "see" it, then you can (try to) run it in AcCoRD.
// It probably won't work because this file provides an exhaustive list of
// configuration options and many of them contradict each other.
// However, this should be not be a problem since the config folder includes
// a number of sample valid configuration files.
// AcCoRD looks for config files first in the current directory, then
// in a "config" subdirectory, then in a "../config/" directory.
// Please refer to README.txt for instructions on running a simulation.
//
// AcCoRD input and summary output files use the JSON format. JSON stands for
// JavaScript Object Notation and it is defined at json.org.
// JSON is a way of organizing data into an object.
//
// AcCoRD requires that names (i.e., the words between double quotes
// and before a colon, e.g., "Output Filename") MUST be written EXACTLY as they are
// in this file. These names are hard-coded into AcCoRD.
//
// Most names are mandatory in a configuration file, though some of them may have
// an empty value associated with them. In particular, "Chemical Reaction Specification"
// is an empty array if there are no chemical reactions to simulate.
//
// The ORDER of name/value pairs does not matter for it to be parsed correctly,
// but the NESTING does. So, for example, you can swap the order of "Output Filename"
// and "Simulation Control", but "Number of Repeats" must be defined inside the
// "Simulation Control" object.
//
// An object is encapsulated inside curly braces {}. A configuration file has one top-level
// object and a number of nested objects. An array is encapsulated inside square brackets [].
// The items in an object are name/value pairs, but the items in an array do not have
// associated names. Items are separated with commas.
//
// Extra white spaces are ignored.
//
// Read below to see a description of the individual parameters

{
	"Notes": "This field replaces commenting.",

		// simulation twice with the same random number seed will produce identical results
		// in the corresponding realizations (i.e., the first realization in each output file
		// will be the same, and the second realization in each output file will be the same, etc).
		// AcCoRD uses explicit seeds (instead of random seeds) for 2 reasons:
		// 1) all results are re-producable
		// 2) by specifying different seeds for different executions of the same simulation,
		// the simulations can be executed on different machines and the output files aggregated
		// without needing to worry about the simulations having the same output.

				// If a reaction is "Membrane Inner" or "Membrane Outer", then it should

				// If a reaction is "Absorbing" or "Desorbing", then it should only be
