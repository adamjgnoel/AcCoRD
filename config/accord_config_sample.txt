	"Description": "This configuration creates 2 molecules in a box and then tracks their locations.
		It's only purpose is to demonstrate the molecule locations can be tracked by an observer.
		The box can also be changed to mesoscopic with multiple subvolumes. When the position
		of a molecule inside a subvolume is needed, a uniform random point is generated within that
		subvolume. This simulation takes much less than 1 second to run on a personal computer.",
