	"Description": "This configuration demonstrates the classical point diffusion scenario,
		where molecules are created at a point and then diffuse into unbounded space. A
		single spherical region is used because spherical regions can be unbounded by setting
		a very large radius, i.e., 1e9999 here. There are four passive actors placed to watch
		the diffusion wave: a sphere centered at the source, two actors (one sphere and one
		rectangle) placed some distance away, and one infinitely large actor to show that all of
		the molecules remain in the system. The point source is defined as a point actor.
		Note that the global subvolume base size is set to a correspondingly
		low value so that the placement of the source is detected. This simulation with 10 repeats
		should take less than 10 seconds to execute on a personal computer.",
