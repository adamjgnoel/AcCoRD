	"Description": "This configuration demonstrates reaction-diffusion in the mesoscopic
		regime. We define a chain of subvolumes that form a pipe. Molecules are added
		by an active actor at one end of the chamber and can convert into an immobile product molecule at the other end. This file has no 2nd order reactions so it also has
		a microscopic equivalent. 1 repeat of this simulation should take less than 1 minute to
		execute on a personal computer (it is much slower).",
