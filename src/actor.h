 * actor.h - operations on array of actors and its elements
 *
 * Last revised for AcCoRD LATEST_VERSION
 *
 * Revision history:
 *
 * Revision LATEST_VERSION
 * - updated call to bPointInRegionNotChild to not exclude surface regions
 *
 * Revision v0.5 (2016-04-15)
 * - added ability to define location of actor by a list of regions
 * - added 2D and surface regions. Regions that have an effective dimension different
 * from their actual dimension cannot be intersected by a actor boundary (such regions
 * must be fully inside). Molecules will not be placed by an actor on a 2D region if
 * the actor overlaps at least 1 3D region
 * - tidied up calculations of subvolume coordinates
 *
 * Revision v0.4.1
 * - improved use and format of error messages
 *
 * Revision v0.4
 * - modified use of unsigned long and unsigned long long to uint32_t and uint64_t
 * - removed deprecated debug function
 * - added accommodation of spherical (microscopic) subvolumes and actors
 * - renamed region structure and array of structures to accommodate naming
 * of new boundary structure
 *
 * Revision v0.3.1
 * - header added
