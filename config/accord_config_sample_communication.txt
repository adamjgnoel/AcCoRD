	"Description": "This configuration consider a simple communications scenario, where a point
		transmitter releases finite-width pulses of molecules based on a modulated binary sequence.
		This configuration was arranged to demonstrate the following functionality:
		- CSK transmission with more than one bit per symbol
		- transmission of modulated signal over a finite pulse width
		- passive receiver (no chemical reaction)		
		One repeat of this simulation should take less than 10 seconds to execute on a personal computer.",
