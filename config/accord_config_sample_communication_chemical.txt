	"Description": "This configuration consider a simple communications scenario where both
		the transmitter and receiver have chemical processes.
		This configuration was arranged to demonstrate the following functionality:
		- CSK transmission with more than one bit per symbol
		- transmission of modulated signal over finite interval with molecules randomly generated.
		- reversible chemical conversion at the receiver surface		
		One repeat of this simulation should take less than a minute to execute on a personal computer.
		The differences in run time compared to the non-chemical version of this simulation are due
		to the definition of 2 regions and not the chemical reactions themselves. A second region is
		required here in order to define where the receiver chemical reactions take place. Most
		computational resources are spent on determining whether the molecules have transitioned
		between the two regions.",
