 * base.c - general utility functions that can apply to different simulation data
 * 			structures
 *
 * Last revised for AcCoRD LATEST_VERSION
 *
 * Revision history:
 *
 * Revision LATEST_VERSION
 * - added 2D rectangle case to point reflection. Actually only works for surface cases,
 * since definition of faces are for the 3D case
 * - added closestFace and distanceToFace functions to find closest boundary face
 * to point (in direction of face normal only)
 * - updated check on a line hitting an infinite plane where acceptance of the distance = 0
 * case is passed as an argument
 *
 * Revision v0.5 (2016-04-15)
 * - filling in cases for 2D Rectangles
 * - added function to calculate boundary surface area. Renamed boundaryArea
 * function to boundaryVolume to avoid name confusion
 * - added function to return string of boundary name and integrated with error
 * messages
 *
 * Revision v0.4.1
 * - improved use and format of error messages
 *
 * Revision v0.4
 * - filled in cases for spherical boundaries to accommodate spherical regions and actors
 * - added clearance to bBoundaryIntersect to account for cases where we need to know
 * whether two shapes are within a specified distance of each other and not just
 * overlapping
 * - added functions for
 * 		- distance between 2 points
 *		- determining whether one shape is completely inside another shape
 * 		- squaring values
 *		- distance to nearest point on boundary
 * 		- determining intersection of line and boundary
 *
 * Revision v0.3.1.1
 * - added check in boundaryArea to identify invalid rectangle and box definitions. Will
 * 	 now return a zero value if boundary is invalid.
 *
 * Revision v0.3.1
 * - header added
 *
 * Created 2015-02-19
