 * region.h - 	operations for (microscopic or mesoscopic) regions in
 * 				simulation environment
 *
 * Last revised for AcCoRD LATEST_VERSION
 *
 * Revision history:
 *
 * Revision LATEST_VERSION
 * - added members to track the direction of microscopic subvolumes from mesoscopic
 * subvolumes. Replaced array for storing coordinates of virtual microscopic
 * subvolume with array of boundary coordinates of boundary mesoscopic subvolumes. These
 * changes needed to accommodate improved hybrid transition algorithms
 * - changed findNearestSub function to return index of subvolume in region's neighID array
 * instead of the global subvolume list. This makes function suitable for more calls.
 * - added case for point boundary when determining intersection with a region
 *
 * Revision v0.5.1 (2016-05-06)
 * - updated function bPointInRegionNotChild to take an extra input to indicate
 * whether to ignore children regions that are surfaces
 * - added bReleaseProduct for surface reactions to indicate whether products are
 * released from the surface
 * - added members to store unique properties needed for absorbing and
 * desorbing reactions
 *
 * Revision v0.5 (2016-04-15)
 * - re-structured region array initialization to nest more code in functions
 * - added more checks on region parameters (including label uniqueness) to verify placement
 * - pushed error exit to end of region initialization so that all errors will be displayed
 * before exiting.
 * - added 2D regions
 * - added type member to spec and plane, dimension, and effectiveDim members to main
 * struct in order to accommodate surface and other 2D regions
 * - added region label when giving errors about region initialization
 * - adjusted clearance between spherical and rectangular regions such that the clearance
 * between them (when one is nested inside the other) is scaled by the subvolume adjacency
 * error
 * - corrected "locking" to spherical region so that the coordinate that is "locked" is
 * the one that is the furthest from the center of the sphere
 *
 * Revision v0.4.1
 * - improved use and format of error messages
 *
 * Revision v0.4
 * - modified use of unsigned long and unsigned long long to uint32_t and uint64_t
 * - added accommodation of spherical (microscopic) subvolumes and actors
 * - created new structure members to account for meso subvolumes that border
 * the same micro region along more than 1 face
 * - renamed region structure and array of structures to accommodate naming
 * of new boundary structure
 *
 * Revision v0.3.1
 * - header added
