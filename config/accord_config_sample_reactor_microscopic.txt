	"Description": "This configuration demonstrates chemical reactions in the microscopic
		regime. We define a single subvolume so there is no diffusion. There is also
		no active actor; all molecules are generated via a 0th order chemical reaction.
		This file has no 2nd order reactions so it can be run in the microscopic regime.
		The default reaction rates result in an expected equilibrium value of 100 molecules
		in the reactor. This simulation with 100 repeats should take less than 10 seconds to
		execute on a personal computer.",
