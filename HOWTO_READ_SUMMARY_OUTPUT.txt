// HOWTO_READ_SUMMARY_OUTPUT.txt - explains how to read the summary output file
// Last revised for AcCoRD v0.4.1

// WARNING: THIS IS NOT A REAL OUTPUT SUMMARY FILE!!!
// THE "COMMENTS" IN THIS FILE MAKE IT UNREADABLE BY THE ACCORD MATLAB IMPORT FUNCTION!
// BUT ... THIS FILE DESCRIBES HOW TO READ A VALID OUTPUT SUMMARY FILE
//
// With that out of the way, welcome to this "tutorial" for examining proper
// AcCoRD output summary files.
//
// This document is current as of v0.4.1 (2016-02-18).
//
// Please note that output summary files will not have these comments
// preceded by "//". 
// Please refer to README.txt for instructions on running a simulation and
// importing output into MATLAB.
//
// AcCoRD simulations generate two types of file. Each simulation has a corresponding
// "output" file and "summary output" file in the "results" folder. The output file
// contains mostly raw simulation
// data, whereas the summary output file has simulation meta-data, including information
// about the amount of data in the output file.
//
// If the output filename (as defined by
// "Output Filename" in the simulation config file) is FILENAME.txt, then the output
// filename in the results folder will be saved as FILENAME_SEEDX.txt, where "X" is the
// seed value specified as a command line argument when the simulation was ran (or by the
// parameter "Random Number Seed" in the config file if no seed number was provided
// as an argument). Similarly, the summary filename will be FILENAME_SEEDX_summary.txt.
//
// AcCoRD input and summary output files (but not data output files)
// use the JSON format. JSON stands for
// JavaScript Object Notation and it is defined at json.org.
// JSON is a way of organizing data into an object.
//
// Names in AcCoRD output files do not have white space in them so that they can be
// cleanly imported into MATLAB.
//
// Read below to see how a output summary file is organized

{	// The first JSON object describes the main top-level properties of the simulation.

	"ConfigFile":	"sample.txt",			// This is the name of the configuration file
											// that was used to generate this output
											// By listing this file, we do not need to repeat
											// the properties that were written in the
											// configuration file.
											
	"SEED":	1,								// This is the random seed that was used to start
											// the random number generator. We have to write
											// it here because it can be different from that
											// written in the configuration file if the user
											// specified a value when starting the simulation.
											
	"NumRepeat":	2,						// The number of independent realizations executed
											// by this simulation
											
	"StartTime":	"2015-05-02 00:48:36"	// (Approximate) local time when the simulation
											// was started
}
{	// The second JSON object summarizes information about the actors that are being recorded

	"NumberActiveActor":	1,	// The number of active actors in the simulation
	
	"ActiveInfo":	[{			// Array of active actors
								
			"ID":	0,			// ID of the actor in the list of defined actors
			
			"MaxBitLength":	3	// The most bits sent by the current actor in any single
								// realization

								// recorded
		
	"RecordInfo":	[{			// Array describing the observations of passive
								// actors being recorded.
	
			"ID":	1,			// ID of the actor in the list of defined actors
			
			"bRecordTime":	0,	// Are the observation times for the current actor being recorded?
			
			"MaxCountLength":	10,	// The most observations made by the current actor in any
									// single realization
			
			"NumMolTypeObs":	1, 	// The number of types of molecules that this actor observes
			
			"MolObsID":	[0],	// Array of IDs of the molecules that are observed by the actor
			
			"bRecordPos":	[1] // Array indicating which molecule types have their positions
								// recorded when they are observed
